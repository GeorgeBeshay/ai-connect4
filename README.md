## Introduction
This Project was developed as a part of the academic course ***CSE 351: Introduction to Ai*** that is being studied on the 6th semester (Fall 2023 / 2024) in the department of *Computer and Systems Engieering*, at the University of Alexandria.
we were assigned to implement an AI agent for the classic Connect 4 game. The project entails implementing the Minimax algorithm (With / Without alpha beta pruning) to create an AI agent capable of playing the game against a human opponent.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to create a Connect 4 game AI agent using the Minimax algorithm. The AI should operate in a human vs. computer mode with a GUI. The game will allow choosing between two algorithms for the AI agent:
- Minimax without alpha-beta pruning
- Minimax with alpha-beta pruning

Additionally, the AI agent should implement heuristic pruning to efficiently evaluate the game state and truncate the game tree after a certain depth (K levels). The heuristic function should consider various factors, aiming to determine the proximity of the computer or human player to winning the game.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a Connect 4 game with a GUI for human vs. computer mode.
- Support two AI algorithms: Minimax without alpha-beta pruning and Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
- Implement heuristic pruning to efficiently evaluate game states.
- Present the Minimax tree for each turn in a readable form or GUI representation (bonus).

## Installation

### Steps to Run the Application:

1. Download the repository ZIP file from [here](link_to_repository_zip).
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Run the main script (navigate to 'src/gui/') for the game in a terminal or command prompt:
    - For Python: `python main.py`
